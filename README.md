# Sublight_Engines_Landing_Page

### For this week's project we had to create a static landing page with HTML and CSS. Ahll the elements for the webpage look were defined in a figma template:

### To create the website, I first proceeded to create the html page, then the images folder and finished with the css file. 

### The page is divided in the following sections:

*header
	navigation bar linked to all sections of the page

*services section
*about us section
*products section
*contact us section with contact request form
*footer section with USA and Canada offices addresses
