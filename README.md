# Sublight_Engines_Landing_Page

### For week 9 of the project 
We had to create a static landing page with HTML and CSS. All the elements for the webpage look were defined in a figma template:

## To create the website 
I first proceeded to create the html page, then the images folder and finished with the css file. 

## The page is divided in the following sections:
`1- Header with navigation bar linkinkg to all sections of the page `
`2- Services Section`
`3- About Us Section`
`4- Products Section`
`5- Contact Us Section with Contact Request Form`
`6- Footer Section`
