# Sublight_Engines_Landing_Page

### For this week's project 
We had to create a static landing page with HTML and CSS. All the elements for the webpage look were defined in a figma template:

### To create the website 
I first proceeded to create the html page, then the images folder and finished with the css file. 

### The page is divided in the following sections:

'1-header
	navigation bar linked to all sections of the page'

'2- services section'
'3- about us section'
'4- products section'
'5- contact us section with contact request form'
'6- footer section with USA and Canada offices addresses'
