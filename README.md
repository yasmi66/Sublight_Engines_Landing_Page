# Sublight_Engines_Landing_Page

### For week 9 of the project 
We had to create a static landing page with HTML and CSS. All the elements for the webpage look were defined in a figma template:

`1- Header with navigation bar linkinkg to all sections of the page `
`2- Services Section`
`3- About Us Section`
`4- Products Section`
`5- Contact Us Section with Contact Request Form`
